I basically followed the same process as I did in 4 calculation, the only difference which is the creativity is that as the user enters his/her's values into textfield those numbers will be multiplied and returned as morse numbers!


   func convertToMorseCode(_ number: Int) -> String {
        let morseCodeDictionary: [Int: String] = [
            0: "-----",
            1: ".----",
            2: "..---",
            3: "...--",
            4: "....-",
            5: ".....",
            6: "-....",
            7: "--...",
            8: "---..",
            9: "----."
        ]

The function takes an integer number (for example, 123) 
and converts it into its corresponding Morse code representation by looking up each digit in 
the morseCodeDictionary. In this case, 123 would be converted to ".---- ..--- ...--" based on the dictionary.
