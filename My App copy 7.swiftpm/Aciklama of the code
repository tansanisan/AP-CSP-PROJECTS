I followed a simple code in my program. I created array for my images so I can increment them by using win, lose and add images as the game continues. 
For the creative side I initially wanted to create buttons which would create a sound as you tap on the button, yet I couldn't find how to add sound/voice to the buttons (I'll ask Sedat) 
so I decided to print sexy emojis based on the whether you lose or win. These emojies are utterly sick, so the person whose playing the hangMan will get really annoyed if they lose lol!
