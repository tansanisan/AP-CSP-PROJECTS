variables, constants, strings, and numbers
1) : variables + constants
var -- enables you to store data and modify it
Ex: 
var name = "Tansa
name = "Ahmet"
name = "Nil" -- by using var you can use different data for the same variable, since you're modifying it! The old value(s) are discarded. 

let -- not changable, it's a constant but again used for storing data
ex: let movie = "godfather" -- as long as you're using "movie" the computer will display your data: godfather

2) : strings 
to display something in " " we use strings
Ex: Text("Hello World") -- is a string which the computer will display the text: Hello World
extra: .count - will give you the number of letters , """ -- if you have mutliple line data you use """ 
ex: let prog = """ I 
                   am
                   CSing
                         """
3) : numbers
 to show big numbers (1000000) -- we use underscore to see the numbers better
 var counter = 20
 counter += 5 -- will give you the number 25 , you can apply this to all x, +, -, / and more
 let number = 100 , print(number.ismultiple(of: 2) -- T/F tells you if it's an factor or not 
 for storing decimals (floating numbers) in some cases you have to identify or you'll have roundoff eror 
                          ex: let a = 1
                              let b = 2.3 
                              let c = a + Int(b) or Double(a) + b -- or else the answer will be different
