Yemek Tarifi and Process 

Yemek Tarifi: 

1) Line ciz --> path { giderek yapacaksin 
2)renklerini editle --> assetlerinden renklerini belirlemelisin
3)uzunluk editle --> path.move + path.addLine ile slope hesaplanarak ilk ve son uclardan bir line olacak
4)animation editle --> trim ve animation sayesinde zamani 2 olarak ayarladigimiz ve butona basildiginda kendiliginden ortaya cikan bir animation olacak.

Process: 

Basically, I have followed a simple code : 

Group{
                    Path(){path in
                        path.move(to: CGPoint(x:250,y:250))//S
                        path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 50, y: 250))//T
                    }
                    .trim(from: 0, to: percentage)
                    .stroke(Color("4C94B6"), style: StrokeStyle(lineWidth: 12.5))
                    .animation(.easeOut(duration: 2.0), value: percentage)

with this code, I was able to draw a line that has a color that I have defined from my assets, a width of 12.5, and generated by animation

Found the initial and final points of my lines by using Geogebra which is an internet site that lets you draw arrows on your image to find their distance apart. here's a picture of how I was able to find my end points:
